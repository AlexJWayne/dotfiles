However, if you want to refer to the struct from within the same file, you can use `@This()` to get a reference to the current file's namespace.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `@This()` to refer to the `Cell` struct from within the same file:\n\n```zig\nconst rl = @import(\"raylib\");\n\nconst Direction = @import(\"./direction.zig\").Direction;\n\npub const Cell = struct {\n    x: i32,\n    y: i32,\n\n    pub fn init(x: i32, y: i32) Cell {\n        return Cell{ .x = x, .y = y };\n    }\n\n    pub fn vector2(self: Cell) rl.Vector2 {\n        return rl.Vector2{\n            @floatFromInt(self.x),\n            @floatFromInt(self.y),\n        };\n    }\n\n    pub fn renderAt(self: Cell) void {\n        self.renderAtFacing(.Right);\n    }\n\n    pub fn renderAtFacing(self: Cell, dir: Direction) void {\n        const pos = self.vector2();\n        rl.gl.rlTranslatef(pos.x, pos.y, 0);\n        rl.gl.rlRotatef(dir.degrees(), 0, 0, 1);\n    }\n};\n\n// Example usage within the same file\npub fn exampleUsage() void {\n    const cell = Cell.init(10, 20);\n    cell.renderAt();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Cell` struct is defined within the file, and you can refer to it directly using `Cell` within the same file. The `exampleUsage` function demonstrates how you can create an instance of `Cell` and call its methods.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":71}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":56},"start":699,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":72}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":57},"start":2111,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":73}}}],"summary":"Referring to Struct Within File","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":614},"icon":"File","label":"PlasmaPlanetV6/src/grid/Cell.zig","metadata":{"path":"PlasmaPlanetV6/src/grid/Cell.zig"}}]}
