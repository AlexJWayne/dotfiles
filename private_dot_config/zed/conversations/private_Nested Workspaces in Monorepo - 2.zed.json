The example you provided already uses glob patterns (`apps/*` and `libs/*`), which will match any directories directly under `apps` and `libs`. If you want to include packages in nested directories, you can use a double asterisk (`**`) to match any level of nesting.\n\nHere is an updated example that includes nested directories:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"workspaces\": [\n    \"apps/**\",\n    \"libs/**\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration will match packages in any nested directories under `apps` and `libs`. For example, it will include `apps/foo`, `apps/foo/bar`, `libs/baz`, and `libs/baz/qux`.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":81}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":52},"start":199,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":82}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":53},"start":887,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":83}}}],"summary":"Nested Workspaces in Monorepo","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":116},"icon":"TextSnippet","label":"solv-monorepo/package.json, Lines 24 to 28","metadata":null}]}
